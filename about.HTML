				<h3>3 things that I hate</h3>
				<section>
					<h3>People who chew with their mouth open: I just think that chewing with your mouth open is inconsiderate and uncomfortable(uncomfortable meaning that you chew cold food and you don't have the inside of your mouth to keep your teeth and gums warm. The only exeption is someone who is 5 or younger.</h3>
					<h3>Beetles. I hate beetles with a passion because of the sound that their wings produce.</h3>
					<h3>Unjustified arrogance: I can't stand people who talk trash and then get disrespected with relative ease.</h3>
